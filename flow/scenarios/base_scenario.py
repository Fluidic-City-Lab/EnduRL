class Scenario(Serializable):
    """Base scenario class.

    Initializes a new scenario. Scenarios are used to specify features of
    a network, including the positions of nodes, properties of the edges
    and junctions connecting these nodes, properties of vehicles and
    traffic lights, and other features as well. These features can later be
    acquired  from this class via a plethora of get methods (see
    documentation).

    This class uses network specific features to generate the necessary network
    configuration files needed to initialize a simulation instance. The methods
    of this class are called by the base scenario class.

    The network files can be created in one of three ways:

    * Custom networks can be generated by defining the properties of the
      network's directed graph. This is done by defining the nodes and edges
      properties using the ``specify_nodes`` and ``specify_edges`` methods,
      respectively, as well as other properties via methods including
      ``specify_types``, ``specify_connections``, etc... For more on this,
      see the tutorial on creating custom scenarios or refer to some of the
      available scenarios.

    * Scenario data can be collected from an OpenStreetMap (.osm) file. The
      .osm file is specified in the NetParams object. For example:

        >>> from flow.core.params import NetParams
        >>> net_params = NetParams(osm_path='/path/to/osm_file.osm')

      In this case, no ``specify_nodes`` and ``specify_edges`` methods are
      needed. However, a ``specify_routes`` method is still needed to specify
      the appropriate routes vehicles can traverse in the network.

    * Scenario data can be collected from an sumo-specific network (.net.xml)
      file. This file is specified in the NetParams object. For example:

        >>> from flow.core.params import NetParams
        >>> net_params = NetParams(netfile='/path/to/netfile.net.xml')

      In this case, no ``specify_nodes`` and ``specify_edges`` methods are
      needed. However, a ``specify_routes`` method is still needed to specify
      the appropriate routes vehicles can traverse in the network.

    This class can be instantiated once and reused in multiple experiments.
    Note that this function stores all the relevant parameters. The
    generate() function still needs to be called separately.

    Attributes
    ----------
    orig_name : str
        the variable provided under the `name` parameter to this object upon
        instantiation
    name : str
        the variable provided under the `name` parameter to this object upon
        instantiation, appended with a timestamp variable. This timestamp is
        meant to differentiate generated scenario files during parallelism
    vehicles : flow.core.params.VehicleParams
        vehicle specific parameters, used to specify the types and number of
        vehicles at the start of a simulation
    net_params : flow.core.params.NetParams
        network specific parameters, used primarily to identify properties of a
        network such as the lengths of edges and the number of lanes in each
        edge. This attribute is very network-specific, and should contain the
        variables denoted by the `ADDITIONAL_NET_PARAMS` dict in each scenario
        class file
    initial_config : flow.core.params.InitialConfig
        specifies parameters that affect the positioning of vehicle in the
        network at the start of a simulation. For more, see flow/core/params.py
    traffic_lights : flow.core.params.TrafficLightParams
        used to describe the positions and types of traffic lights in the
        network. For more, see flow/core/params.py
    nodes : list of dict or None
        list of nodes that are assigned to the scenario via the `specify_nodes`
        method. All nodes in this variable are expected to have the following
        properties:

        * **name**: a unique identifier for the node
        * **x**: x-coordinate of the node, in meters
        * **y**: y-coordinate of the node, in meters

        If the scenario is meant to generate the network from an OpenStreetMap
        or template file, this variable is set to None
    edges : list of dict or None
        edges that are assigned to the scenario via the `specify_edges` method.
        This include the shape, position, and properties of all edges in the
        network. These properties include the following mandatory properties:

        * **id**: name of the edge
        * **from**: name of the node the edge starts from
        * **to**: the name of the node the edges ends at
        * **length**: length of the edge

        In addition, either the following properties need to be specifically
        defined or a **type** variable property must be defined with equivalent
        attributes in `self.types`:

        * **numLanes**: the number of lanes on the edge
        * **speed**: the speed limit for vehicles on the edge

        Moreover, the following attributes may optionally be available:

        * **shape**: the positions of intermediary nodes used to define the
          shape of an edge. If no shape is specified, then the edge will appear
          as a straight line.

        Note that, if the scenario is meant to generate the network from an
        OpenStreetMap or template file, this variable is set to None
    types : list of dict or None
        A variable used to ease the definition of the properties of various
        edges. Each element in the list consists of a dict consisting of the
        following property:

        * **id**: name of the edge type. Edges in the `self.edges` attribute
          with a similar value under the "type" key will adopt the properties
          of other components of this list, such as "speed" and "numLanes".

        If the type variable is None, then no types are available within the
        scenario.

        Note that, if the scenario is meant to generate the network from an
        OpenStreetMap or template file, this variable is set to None
    connections : list of dict or None
        TODO

        If the connections attribute is set to None, then the connections
        within the network will be specified by the simulator.

        Note that, if the scenario is meant to generate the network from an
        OpenStreetMap or template file, this variable is set to None
    routes : dict
        A variable whose keys are the starting edge of a specific route and the
        element is the list of edges a vehicle is meant to traverse starting
        from that edge. These are only applied at the start of a simulation;
        vehicles are allowed to reroute within the environment immediately
        afterwards.
    edge_starts : list of (str, float)
        a list of tuples in which the first element of the tuple is the name of
        the edge/intersection/internal_link, and the second value is the
        distance of the link from some global reference, i.e. [(link_0, pos_0),
        (link_1, pos_1), ...]
    internal_edge_starts : list of (str, float)
        A variable similar to `self.edge_starts` but for junctions within the
        network. If no junctions are available, this variable will return the
        default variable: `[(':', -1)]` needed by sumo simulations.
    intersection_edge_starts : list of (str, float)
        A variable similar to `self.edge_starts` but for intersections within
        the network. This variable will be deprecated in future releases.

    Example
    -------
    The following examples are derived from the `LoopScenario` Scenario class
    located in flow/scenarios/loop.py, and should serve as an example of the
    types of outputs to be expected from the different variables of a scenario
    class.

    First of all, a the ring road scenario class can be instantiated by running
    the following commands (note if this this unclear please refer to Tutorial
    1):

    >>> from flow.scenarios import LoopScenario
    >>> from flow.core.params import NetParams, VehicleParams
    >>>
    >>> scenario = LoopScenario(
    >>>     name='test',
    >>>     vehicles=VehicleParams(),
    >>>     net_params=NetParams(
    >>>         additional_params={
    >>>             'length': 230,
    >>>             'lanes': 1,
    >>>             'speed_limit': 30,
    >>>             'resolution': 40,
    >>>         }
    >>>     )
    >>> )

    The various attributes then look as follows:

    >>> print(scenario.nodes)
    >>> [{'id': 'bottom', 'x': '0', 'y': '-36.60563691113593'},
    >>>  {'id': 'right', 'x': '36.60563691113593', 'y': '0'},
    >>>  {'id': 'top', 'x': '0', 'y': '36.60563691113593'},
    >>>  {'id': 'left', 'x': '-36.60563691113593', 'y': '0'}]


    >>> print(scenario.edges)
    >>> [
